# Coalescent_Bf_institute_project
The repository of my 2nd semester project in Bioinfirmatics Institute.
It contains my code used for obtaining distributions of different statistics and allele-frequency spectra - Maincode.py (may be not the best name, but it's something I came up with at the time). It also contains the folder with betatree - a simulator written in Neher laboratory, which I downloaded from his repository - 
https://github.com/neherlab/betatree
And modified it so that it now provides a possibility of switching between selection and neutrality periods. There really wasn't much to do, actually, so it's mostly original.
There are also pictures I got. The name of a file corresponds to a statistics it represent. Not surprisingly. On each picture green line represents full selection mode (Bolthausen-Sznitman coalescent), red line - full neutrality mode (Kingsman coalescent) and the rest - intermediate states with step 0.1, the darker, the more neutral.
